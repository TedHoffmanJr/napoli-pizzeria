# About Us – Napoli Pizzeria

At Napoli Pizzeria, we believe pizza is more than food — it’s a craft, a conversation, and a connection to tradition.

Owner and head pizzaiolo **Mike Perrucci** has spent decades in the pizza industry, perfecting his dough, mastering old-school techniques, and staying true to the fundamentals that make a great pie unforgettable. Every pizza that leaves the oven at Napoli is made with purpose — using quality ingredients, consistent technique, and just the right balance of heart and heat.

We’re proud to serve **authentic NY-style pizza** that reflects the best of both worlds: big city flavor, small town hospitality. Whether you’re grabbing a slice on your lunch break, feeding the whole family, or catering a group at the hospital down the road — we make sure every order hits the mark.

Mike’s always around — tossing dough, checking the ovens, or chatting with customers at the counter. His philosophy is simple: *“Make the kind of pizza you’d be proud to serve your friends and family — every single time.”* And it shows.

So if you're nearby, stop in and say hey. We’d love to make you something great.

**Good pizza. Good people. Napoli Pizzeria.**
