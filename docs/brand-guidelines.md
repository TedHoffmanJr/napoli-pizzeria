## 🎨 Visual Style & Image Prompts

- Emphasis on **clean, high-contrast layouts**  
- Use of **hand-drawn or line-art food illustrations** in margins/dividers  
- Prefer **white marble, rustic wood, or stainless steel** backdrops  
- Maintain soft, warm lighting and shallow depth of field in images  
- Avoid yellow in design; substitute with red or green from brand palette

## 📏 Image Standards (for Canva SVGs or Background Illustrations)

- Recommended Size: **800×800 px** (SVG, PNG, or JPG)  
- Keep file names kebab-case: `pizza-illustration.svg`, `tomato-outline.svg`  
- Export as `.svg` or `.png` for web use  
- Maintain stroke consistency and transparent backgrounds

Use consistent illustration proportions and negative space so graphics align cleanly on web sections.
